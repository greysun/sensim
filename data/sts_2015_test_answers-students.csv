1429~The positive battery terminal is separated by a gap from terminal 4.~Terminal 4 and the positive battery terminal are in the same electrical state~1.4
1432~there is a gap between the positive battery connection and the bulb terminal.~there is no gap between the terminals~1.6
1433~a gap causes a lost connection~A non-zero voltage means that the terminals are not connected.~3.0
1435~The electrical state is interferred with.~A non-zero voltage means that the terminals are not connected.~1.8
1436~because bulb c was in an open path~Bulb C was not in a closed path~4.6
1437~bulb a is on a closed path with the battery~Bulb A is still in a closed path with the battery~4.6
1438~because the battery has its own chemical reacion between the positive and negative tterminals it contains~A battery uses a chemical reaction to maintain different electrical states at the terminals~4.2
1439~a terminal is connected to the positive terminal of the battery~Terminal 5 and the positive terminal are connected~4.0
1446~a terminal is connected to another terminal~Terminals 4, 5 and 6 are connected to the positive battery terminal~2.2
1447~Bulb A and C are still in a closed path with the battery.~Bulbs A and C are still contained in closed paths with the battery~5.0
1448~When the switch is in the same path as the bulb.~When the switch and the bulb are contained in the same path~4.4
1449~because each bulb has its own complete path~each bulb is in its own path~4.0
1453~The positive battery terminal was not seperated by a gap from terminal 4.~Terminal 4 and the positive terminal are not separated by the gap~5.0
1454~terminal 6 is connected to terminal 1~Terminals 1 and 6 are separated by the gap~2.2
1456~bulb a and bulb c are wired in parallel~A and C are in different paths~1.4
1457~that the battery connection does not work~there is a short circuit~1.2
1459~if there is a gap in the circuit there the bulb will not light up.~A non-zero voltage means that the terminals are not connected.~1.0
1460~terminal 1 and 2 have the same difference in electrical states~Terminals 1 and 2 are connected and in the same electrical state~3.6
1462~The path must be closed~If a bulb and a switch are in the same path the switch affects the bulb~1.4
1463~it was connected to the positive terminal~Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap~1.4
1464~It has its own path connected to the battery~each bulb is in its own path~3.2
1465~if it is in the same path as the bulb~When the switch and the bulb are contained in the same path~3.4
1469~the battery is in a closed path.~the battery is contained in a path in which there is no bulb~1.4
1470~Bulb A has a closed pathway~Bulb A was still contained in the same closed path with the battery.~4.0
1471~it depends on whether its an open or closed path~If a bulb and a switch are in the same path the switch affects the bulb~1.4
1474~Because terminal 1 is seperated from the positive battery terminal.~Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap~4.4
1475~When it is on the same pathway as the batter and the bulb.~When the switch and the bulb are contained in the same path~3.2
1476~because there is a difference in electrial states between the two terminals~A battery uses a chemical reaction to maintain different electrical states at the terminals~3.0
1479~The are both connected the negative battery terminal.~Terminals 1 and 2 are connected~3.2
1483~the two terminals will both be 0~The terminals are in the same state.~3.6
1485~The damaged bulb B has left a gap in the path so the charge can not reach it~Terminals 1, 2 and 3 are separated from the positive battery terminal by a gap~1.2
1488~A closed path with a battery enables the bulb to be on.~If a bulb and a switch are in the same path the switch affects the bulb~2.0
1490~the bulb will be burned out because the terminals~The damaged bulb and the other bulb must be contained in the same path~1.2
1491~The battery is in a closed path that does not contain any other components.~The battery is contained in a path which does not contain any other components~4.0
1494~the terminals are not connected~Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are not connected~2.8
1496~because bulbs b and c are in a closed path with the battery.~Bulb B and Bulb C were still contained in the same closed path with the battery.~4.6
1497~because there was a positive and negative connection~terminal 1 is connected to the negative battery terminal~2.0
1498~it was seperated by a gap from terminal 3~Terminal 3 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap~3.8
