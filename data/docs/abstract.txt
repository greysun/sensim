We propose a new statistical approach for characterizing the class separability degree in Ê Ô . This approach is based on a nonparametric statistic called “the Cut Edge Weight”. We show in this paper the principle and the experimental applications of this statistic. First, we build a geometrical connected graph like Toussaint’s Relative Neigh-bourhood Graph on all examples of the learning set. Second, we cut all edges between two examples of a different class. Third, we compute the relative weight of these cut edges. If the relative weight of the cut edges is in the expected range of a random distribution of the labels on all the neighbourhood of the graph’s vertices, then no neighbourhood-based method provides a reliable prediction model. We will say then that the classes to predict are non-separable.
